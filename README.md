## Gitcho Fruits Website

**Objective**
You and 2 or 3 other classmates will be making a Bootstrap website for some imaginary company you come up with!

**Requirements**
Your website should include at least these pages: Home, About Us, Sign Up / Subscribe
The About Us page should have info for each team member. Each team member is responsible for adding their own info.
The Sign Up or Subscribe page should have a form with text input + another type of input (radio button, dropdown select, etc.)
Everyone must contribute to the same Github repository. No one may commit/push to the master branch. Create your own branches while working, and use the "Pull Request" option in github to merge code into the master branch.

*Recommendations*
Quickly sketch a consistent design for each page before writing any code.
Before pushing your code to Github, make sure to pull down master and merge it into your local branch.
Have your teammates look over your Pull Request before merging it into master, and instruct your teammates to pull down master after your Pull Request.
